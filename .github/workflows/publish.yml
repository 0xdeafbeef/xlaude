        # Setup trusted publishing on crates.io:
        # 1. Go to https://crates.io/me
        # 2. Go to "Publish Permissions" for the crate
        # 3. Add GitHub Actions as a trusted publisher:
        #    - Repository: xuanwo/xlaude
        #    - Workflow: publish.yml
        #    - Environment: crates.io (optional but recommended)
